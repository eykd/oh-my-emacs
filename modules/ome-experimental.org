#+TITLE: Oh My Emacs GUI

This is part of the [[https://github.com/xiaohanyu/oh-my-emacs][oh-my-emacs]].

This file contains some experimental packages, which may be:
- not stable enough
- usable, with some minor annoying problems
- young packages without long time testing and validating.

Load necessary packages as you like.

#+NAME: experimental-prerequisites
#+CAPTION: Prerequisites for ome-experimental module
|         | Windows | Ubuntu/Debian/Mint | ArchLinux | Fedora | Mac OS X | Mandatory? |
|---------+---------+--------------------+-----------+--------+----------+------------|
| [[http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/][Doxygen]] |         | doxygen            |           |        |          | No         |

Note:
- [[http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/][Doxygen]], even if you don't have doxygen installed, you can still use
  doxymacs to insert doxygen-style comments. So I make this dependency
  optional. However, so many Mac OS users have problems with this el-get
  package, so I move

|------------------+--------------+--------------------------------------------|
| [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LaCarte][lacarte]]          | Recommended  | Access menubar in minibuffer command loop. |
| [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SrSpeedbar][SrSpeedbar]]       | Experimental | Make [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/speedbar/index.html][Speedbar]] show in same frame.          |
| [[https://github.com/aspiers/smooth-scrolling][smooth-scrolling]] | Recommended  | Emacs smooth scrolling package.            |
| [[https://github.com/nflath/hungry-delete][hungry-delete]]    | Experimental | Enables hungry deletion in all modes.      |
| [[http://doxymacs.sourceforge.net/][doxymacs]]         | Experimental | Literate comments for cc-mode.             |

Note:
- [[http://doxymacs.sourceforge.net/][doxymacs]]: There're many Mac OS users having problems building with this
  package, so I have to move this package from ome-cc module to
  ome-experimental module. See [[https://github.com/xiaohanyu/oh-my-emacs/issues/17][github issue]] for details.

* Lacarte
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: lacarte
  :END:

By default, oh-my-emacs disables =menu-bar-mode=. Of course you can turn it on
by =M-x menu-bar-mode=, however, most of the time menubar in Emacs is useless.
Unfortunately, there may be some times that we want to access the menubar just
to find or execute oblivious command. For example, the prefix key of
=outline-mode= is =C-c @=, which is quite hard to type, and I often forgot the
normal keybindings of outline-minor-mode. The normal workflow for this case is
divided into three steps:
1. turn on the menubar by =M-x menu-bar-mode=
2. find/execute the command you want
3. turn off the menubar again by =M-x menu-bar-mode=

Ah, a little tedious, isn't it? Fortunately, with [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LaCarte][lacarte]], I can just =M-x
lacarte-execute-menu-command=, and it will lead me to the right place. Helm
also provides a =helm-source-lacarte= for lacarte support. See [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/blob/master/helm-misc.el][helm-misc.el]] for
details.

* Hungry-delete
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: hungry-delete
  :END:

CC-mode does have some good [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/ccmode/Minor-Modes.html][innovations]], among which hungry-delete is what I
want most. Fortunately, a good guy ported [[https://github.com/nflath/hungry-delete][hungry-delete]] from cc-mode to a
independent package.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun ome-hungry-delete-setup ()
    (dolist (hook '(text-mode-hook prog-mode-hook comint-mode-hook))

* Documentation with Doxymacs in CC-mode
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: doxymacs
  :END:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Doxygen is the de facto standard tool for generating documentation from
annotated C++ sources, but it also supports other popular programming languages
such as C, Objective-C, C#, PHP, Java, Python, IDL (Corba, Microsoft, and
UNO/OpenOffice flavors), Fortran, VHDL, Tcl, and to some extent D.

[[http://doxymacs.sourceforge.net/][Doxymacs]] brings the power of doxygen to Emacs, you can easily insert Doxygen
style comments in emacs. The default keybindings are:
- =C-c d ?= look up documentation for the symbol under the point.
- =C-c d r= rescan your Doxygen tags file.
- =C-c d f= insert a Doxygen comment for the next function.
- =C-c d i= insert a Doxygen comment for the current file.
- =C-c d ;= insert a Doxygen comment for a member variable on the current line
  (like M-;).
- =C-c d m= insert a blank multi-line Doxygen comment.
- =C-c d s= insert a blank single-line Doxygen comment.
- =C-c d @= insert grouping comments around the current region.

If you like, you can even integrate Doxygen to CMake workflow, see [[http://majewsky.wordpress.com/2010/08/14/tip-of-the-day-cmake-and-doxygen/][here]].
